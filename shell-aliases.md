# Shell Aliases for Claude Code

Two shell aliases streamline launching Claude Code sessions with this workspace.

## Setup

Add these lines to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
alias cs='claude "/prime"'
alias cr='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/prime"'
```

Then reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc`

## The Aliases

### `cs` — Claude Safe

```bash
alias cs='claude "/prime"'
```

Launches Claude Code and immediately runs `/prime` to load workspace context. Claude will ask for permission before executing commands, reading sensitive files, or making changes.

**Use when:** Starting a new session where you want to review and approve each action.

### `cr` — Claude Run

```bash
alias cr='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/prime"'
```

Launches Claude Code with permission prompts disabled, then runs `/prime`. Claude can execute commands and make changes without asking for approval.

**Use when:** You trust the task, want faster iteration, or are doing routine work where constant approvals slow you down.

## Why Both?

- **`cs`** gives you oversight — good for unfamiliar tasks, sensitive operations, or when you want to learn what Claude is doing
- **`cr`** gives you speed — good for familiar workflows where you trust Claude to operate autonomously

Both run `/prime` automatically so Claude starts every session fully oriented to your workspace, goals, and context.
