## Automation Note

_This file works as a static snapshot, but can be enhanced with scripts that pull live data. Once comfortable with the workspace, consider adding a script to `scripts/` that refreshes this file from your data sources (dashboards, APIs, spreadsheets, etc.)._

_Update regularly — stale data limits Claude's usefulness as an analytical partner._
